# Givair Code explained


## Description

This README explains how to run two codes: the Heatmap and the Predictive model.

### Dependencies

* Python (Jupyter Notebook)
* Datetime (pip install datetime)
* Tkinter (pip install tkinter)

### Installing

* Download the zip file containing: Heatmap_Givair.ipynb, arrondissements-occitanie.json.txt, Data_Sensors.csv

### The Heatmap 

* Open Jupyter Notebook. 
* You need to run the Heatmap_Givair.ipynb with, in the same folder, the 2 other files because data are retrieved from these files. Otherwise, you will get errors from the code when running it. 
* You will run the code in the order that the cells appear.
* Run the first cells that tell you what you need to install and what libraries to import. 
* Then, run the cells that will require the date and the hour, a window will open so you can select the data. 
* After that, you keep running the cells, and another window will open so you can select the particule you want to be displayed in the heatmap.
* You will need to run the cells that generate the heatmap, it should be display in little in the "output" section. 
* To have the map in a new window, you run the last cell that save the generated heatmap and save automatically in a .html format, and also automatically, a new window will pop, displaying this time the map in a new tab of your browser.
